        "Collective adaptive systems are an emerging class of networked computational systems, particularly suited in application domains such as smart cities, complex sensor networks, and the Internet of Things. These systems tend to feature large scale, heterogeneity of communication model (including opportunistic peer-to-peer wireless interaction), and require inherent self-adaptiveness properties to address unforeseen changes in operating conditions. In this context, it is extremely difficult (if not seemingly intractable) to engineer reusable pieces of distributed behaviour so as to make them provably correct and smoothly composable.",
        "Building on the field calculus, a computational model (and associated toolchain) capturing the notion of aggregate network-level computation, we address this problem with an engineering methodology coupling formal theory and computer simulation. On the one hand, functional properties are addressed by identifying the largest-to-date field calculus fragment generating self-stabilising behaviour, guaranteed to eventually attain a correct and stable final state despite any transient perturbation in state or topology, and including highly reusable building blocks for information spreading, aggregation, and time evolution. On the other hand, dynamical properties are addressed by simulation, empirically evaluating the different performances that can be obtained by switching between implementations of building blocks with provably equivalent functional properties. Overall, our methodology sheds light on how to identify core building blocks of collective behaviour, and how to select implementations that improve system performance while leaving overall system function and resiliency properties unchanged."

        "We study the problem of broadcasting a common, possibly large, content into a wireless mesh network consisting of N end-users and of one or multiple access points that act as gateways to Internet. Each end-user is characterized by a maximum possible reception rate that depends on the distance and on the interface used to communicate with the associated access point. The end-user satisfaction is proportional to the actual rate received. The overall end-user satisfaction is the sum of the satisfaction of each end-user. Our goal is to maximize the overall end-user satisfaction under the constraint that the access points can retransmit at different rates the same common content at most K times.",
        "We show that the problem can be solved by serving the end-users according to a suitable K segmentation, which is a K partition of the end-users that preserves a specific end-user order. When the access points and the end-users have a unique interface, the optimal segmentation can be found in O(N(K+log⁡N)) time by exploiting the convex Monge property of the satisfaction function. When both access points and end-users are equipped with multiple interfaces, the problem becomes computationally intractable, even for a single access point. Polynomial time algorithms are then devised for optimally solving some meaningful particular cases."

We introduce a stronger form of resurrection axioms (the iterated resurrection axioms RAα(Γ) for a class of forcings Γ and a given ordinal α), and show that RAω(Γ) implies generic absoluteness for the first-order theory of Hγ+ with respect to forcings in Γ preserving the axiom, where γ=γΓ is a cardinal which depends on Γ (γΓ=ω1 if Γ is any among the classes of countably closed, proper, semiproper, stationary set preserving forcings).",
        "We also prove that the consistency strength of these axioms is below that of a Mahlo cardinal for most forcing classes, and below that of a stationary limit of supercompact cardinals for the class of stationary set preserving posets. Moreover, we outline that simultaneous generic absoluteness for Hγ+0 with respect to Γ0 and for Hγ1+ with respect to Γ1 with γ0=γΓ0≠γΓ1=γ1 is in principle possible, and we present several natural models of the Morse–Kelley set theory where this phenomenon occurs (even for all Hγ simultaneously). Finally, we compare the iterated resurrection axioms (and the generic absoluteness results we can draw from them) with a variety of other forcing axioms, and also with the generic absoluteness results by Woodin and the second author."

We argue that these statistics have great value as well in dynamic IoT contexts: they can support complex computational activities involving distributed coordination and provision of situation recognition. We show that the HyperANF algorithm for calculating the neighbourhood function of vertices of a graph naturally allows for a fully distributed and asynchronous implementation, thanks to a mapping to the field calculus, a distribution model proposed for collective adaptive systems. This mapping gives evidence that the field calculus framework is well-suited to accommodate massively parallel computations over graphs. Furthermore, it provides a new “self-stabilising” building block which can be used in aggregate computing in several contexts, there including improved leader election or network vulnerabilities detection."

        "With the constant increase in the number of interconnected devices in today networks, and the high demand of adaptiveness, more and more computations can be designed according to self-organisation principles. In this context, a key building block for large-scale system coordination, called gradient, is used to estimate distances in a fully-distributed way: it is the basis for a vast variety of higher level patterns including information broadcast, events forecasting, distributed sensing, and so on. However, computing gradients is very problematic in mobile environments: the fastest self-healing gradient conceived so far (called BIS) achieves a reaction speed proportional to the single-path speed of information in the network. In this paper we introduce a new gradient algorithm, SVD (Stale Values Detection) gradient, which uses broadcasts to reach a reaction speed that is equal to the multi-path speed of information, namely, the fastest speed possibly achievable by network algorithms. We then combine SVD with other blocks (metric correction, smooth filtering, BIS gradient, information damping) proposing a composed block called ULT(imate) gradient. We evaluate the resulting algorithm and compare it with other approaches, showing it scores best both on accuracy and smoothness while keeping communication cost under control."

We propose a disciplined programming approach based on the interplay between a weak and a strong version of alignment, mixing static and dynamic checks. This is exemplified to design a new reusable component dynamically updating the strategy by which a device can extract information from neighbours, which find applications, for instance, in the on-the-fly evolution of metrics in smart mobility applications."

This problem arises in designing efficient data-diffusion broadcast algorithms in a smart environment. We show that the basic dynamic rogramming algorithm for solving the uniform pallocation problem can be speedup up to O(NK) time by applying an optimal algorithm to find the row-minima of totally monotone matrices. Such a new algorithm is always faster than the best previously known algorithm for the uniform allocation problem that runs in O(NKlogN). Moreover, it is computationally optimal for the uniform allocation of up to N data and K channels. We then reduce the largest allocation problem, i.e., the subproblem with exactly N data and K channels, to the problem of finding a minimum weight K-link path in a particular directed acyclic graph. We also present two heuristics and we show by extended simulations their effectiveness in practical scenarios. Both the K-link path algorithm and the heuristics are much faster than O(NK). We then compare the behaviours of our algorithms on the online version of the allocation problem in which new single items are inserted for broadcast."

Uno sguardo disattento potrebbe quindi concludere che questa manifestazione coinvolga un numero troppo esiguo di persone (proprio in quanto competizione) per avere un impatto dal punto di vista educativo, e che sia svolta a un livello troppo prematuro (data la giovane età dei partecipanti) per avere un impatto dal punto di vista del progresso scientifico. Tuttavia, entrambe queste conclusioni sono inesatte e trascurano molti aspetti del progetto che trascendono le singole gare di cui è composto. Come approfondiremo meglio più avanti, le OII sono infatti un’occasione di ritrovo oltre che una competizione; e come tale hanno avuto il ruolo di mettere in rete scuole del territorio e docenti, promuovendo e dando visibilità all’entusiasmo degli insegnanti che in questo modo hanno trovato occasioni pubbliche per confrontarsi con ragazzi e colleghi in altre scuole e nelle università. Ognuno dei docenti e dei ragazzi che ha partecipato alle OII ha fatto ritorno a casa con un nuovo bagaglio di esperienze e contatti, ha esteso gli effetti di questa manifestazione nel proprio territorio a persone che non vi hanno partecipato direttamente promuovendo così, in modo trasversale ma sempre guardando ai giovani, le conoscenze informatiche così importanti ai giorni nostri. D'altro lato, evidenze statistiche mostrano come buone prestazioni a livello di problem-solving (e in particolare di Olimpiadi di Informatica) si traducano, anni dopo, in maggiori probabilità di lavorare in campo informatico sia nella ricerca pubblica che in aziende private, contribuendo in questo modo allo sviluppo della materia. Ma il ruolo delle Olimpiadi non si ferma all’individuazione delle eccellenze, fornendo visibilità, borse di studio o contatti. Quello che è molto più importante, e che genuinamente caratterizza le OII, è che esse forniscono a ragazzi dotati di talento una possibilità di raggiungere consapevolezza dei propri interessi e delle proprie capacità, fornendo così una motivazione e occasioni di miglioramento che difficilmente potrebbero verificarsi lungo un programma didattico uniformato, che spesso non li spinge a superare i propri limiti. In questo articolo ci proponiamo di presentare le Olimpiadi di Informatica in Italia descrivendone la struttura, illustrando il tipo di competenze coinvolte e riportando testimonianze dirette di docenti e studenti che hanno attivamente partecipato a questo progetto, con l’attenzione volta soprattutto a riferimenti ed esempi che possano essere utili per chi si avvicina alle OII per la prima volta."

Per iniziare un allenamento di tipo pratico, abbiamo inserito alcuni esercizi alla fine di ogni capitolo, di cui una parte con soluzione proposta nella parte finale del fascicolo; molti altri se ne possono trovare in [2], [3] e [4], raccolte di problemi proposti effettivamente in sede olimpica. Abbiamo scelto, alla fine di ogni capitolo, di segnalare alcuni esercizi presi da queste fonti, citando semplicemente la gara e il numero di esercizio corrispondente (nei riferimenti a [4]), o il codice numerico (nei riferimenti a [2] o [3]).

Infine abbiamo inserito, per chi fosse particolarmente interessato e volesse spingersi un po’ oltre quelle che possono essere le ambizioni di base, alcuni paragrafi di approfondimento, nei quali vengono introdotti e affrontati alcuni argomenti più impegnativi e meno comuni, ma che possono comunque risultare utili nella risoluzione di problemi olimpionici, in particolare nelle fasi più avanzate della gara.

        "The complexity of large-scale distributed systems, particularly when deployed in physical space, calls for new mechanisms to address composability and reusability of collective adaptive behaviour. Computational fields have been proposed as an effective abstraction to fill the gap between the macro-level of such systems (specifying a system’s collective behaviour) and the micro-level (individual devices’ actions of computation and interaction to implement that collective specification), thereby providing a basis to better facilitate the engineering of collective APIs and complex systems at higher levels of abstraction. This paper proposes a full formal foundation for field computations, in terms of a core (higher-order) calculus of computational fields containing a few key syntactic constructs, and equipped with typing, denotational and operational semantics. Critically, this allows formal establishment of a link between the micro- and macro-levels of collective adaptive systems, by a result of computational adequacy and abstraction for the (aggregate) denotational semantics with respect to the (per-device) operational semantics."

        "Scenarios like wireless network networks, Internet of Things, and pervasive computing, promote full distribution of computation as well as opportunistic, peer-to-peer interactions between devices spread in the environment. In this context, computing estimated distances between devices in the network is a key component, commonly referred to as the gradient self-organisation pattern: it is frequently used to broadcast information, forecast pointwise events, as carrier for distributed sensing, and as combinator for higher-level spatial structures. However, computing gradients is very problematic in an environment affected by mutability in the position and working frequency of devices: existing algorithms fail in reaching adequate trade offs between accuracy and reaction speed to environment changes.",
        "We propose BIS (Bounded Information Speed) gradient, a fully-distributed algorithm which uses time information to achieve a smooth and predictable reaction speed, and prove it is optimal across algorithms following a single-path-communication strategy to spread information. We empirically evaluate BIS gradient and compare it with other approaches, showing that BIS achieves the best accuracy while keeping smoothness under control, and accordingly enables for improved performance when used as building block in more complex algorithms for creating spatial structures and performing distributed collection of data."

        "The driving motivation to embark in the researches presented in this book has been the following: give a satisfactory sound explanation rooted in mathematical logic for the success forcing axioms have met in settling so many problems formalizable in third order arithmetic. Most of these problems are otherwise undecidable on the basis of ZFC alone. Why forcing axioms have been so successful? We believe that the results of part VI provide a solid mathematical explanation: strong forcing axioms yield as a natural byproduct strong generic absoluteness results for third order arithmetic. This occurs much in the same way as large cardinal axioms do for second order number theory. Therefore large cardinals and forcing axioms transform forcing from a tool to prove independence results into a tool to prove theorems. Moreover the axiom of determinacy AD plays a crucial role in providing a new powerful tool to settle most of the questions on second order arithmetic which are independent from ZFC; likewise Martin’s maximum plays the same role for third order arithmetic as AD does for second order arithmetic. We do not want to dwelve further on this theme here; the motivated reader is referred to [53], the introductory parts of [3, 51, 52], and (for a more technical set of results) to the results of Chapter 8."

We tried to make our presentation accessible to any scholar who has some familiarity with forcing and boolean valued models and full details of all proofs are given.",
        "We focus our presentation using the boolean algebra language and defining an iteration system as a directed and commutative system of complete and injective homomorphisms between complete and atomless boolean algebras.",
        "It is well known that the boolean algebra approach to forcing and iterations is fully equivalent to the standard one. While there are several monographs where forcing is introduced by means of boolean valued models, to our knowledge no detailed account of iterated forcing following a boolean algebraic approach has yet appeared. We believe that this different approach is fruitful since the richness of the algebraic language simplifies many calculations and definitions, among which that of RCS-limits. Some of the advantages of this approach have been already outlined by Donder and Fuchs.",
        "The first part of these notes present the general framework needed to develop the notion of limit of an iterated system of forcings in the boolean algebraic language. The second part contains a proof of the main result of Shelah on semiproper iterations, i.e. that RCS-limit of semiproper iterations are semiproper."

Our purpose is to give a brief account on forcing axioms with a special focus on some consequences of them (SRP, OCA, PID). These principles were first isolated by Todorcevic and interpolate most consequences of MM and PFA, thus providing a useful insight on the combinatorial structure of the theory of forcing axioms.",
        "In the first part of this notes we will give a brief account on forcing axioms, introducing some equivalent definition by means of generalized stationarity and presenting the consequences of them in terms of generic absoluteness.",
        "In the second part we will state the strong reflection principle (SRP), prove it under MM and examine its main consequences. This axiom is defined in terms of reflection properties of generalized stationary set.",
        "In the third part we will state the open coloring axiom (OCA), and provide consistency proofs for some versions of it. This axiom can be seen as a sort of two-dimensional perfect set property, i.e. the basic descriptive set theory result that every analytic set is either countable or it contains a perfect subset.",
